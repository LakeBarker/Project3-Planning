#Project 3 Plan for team "We Didn't Start the Fire"

##Overview

###Name Ideas:
Crystal Door
Crystal Pane
Hardware Limitation (because we, the software engineers are being limited by the hardware, which is the company)

The idea behind _________ is to give software engineers a place to share their experiences working for different companies, and allow those new engineers approaching companies to understand what to expect. By giving an average salary range for different classes of “experience”, it also gives the engineer good information that they can use to negotiate for their worth.


##User Stories

### MVP
As a user I want the ability to…
-View companies and ratings without signing in
-Sign up with an username and password
-Sign in on the same page
-Browse companies using a search function
-Have a snapshot of each company that shows a general rating from 1-5 with decimals (i.e. 4.3, 1.5 etc.)
-Have a “show” page for each company that has more information
-Create reviews that can be as in depth or short as the user wants, to a certain point. ( there needs to be a general rating at the very least)
-Comment both on the company and individual reviews
-Reviews will be able to contain
--General rating from 1-5
--Workplace atmosphere 1-5
